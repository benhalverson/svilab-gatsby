              <p>
                Pitching to investors is a “right-of-passage” for entrepreneurs.
                Raising funds usually takes much more time than founders expect.
                It often takes dozens – even a hundred or more meetings to meet
                the investment goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many people think pitching to investors is about following a
                slide template and learning how to talk in front of the room.
              </p>

              <p>But it’s much more than that. </p>
              <p>Make an effective pitching includes the ability to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Create a vision with personal credibility. </li>
                <li>Understand and speak to the investor mindset. </li>
                <li>
                  Present and discuss your plan in a brief, powerful way like a
                  seasoned executive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use key metrics built upon customer validation, research and
                  go-to-market planning.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Acknowledge and manage risk; (many founders do everything to
                  discount risk which does not work).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Demonstrate being “coachable, adaptable and responsible.”
                </li>
              </ul>

              </ul>
              <p>
                Normally 4 days are needed to get to a basic proficiency level
                for college grads with a few years work experience and a working
                prototype. Each day after that allows us to increase skills with
                the attendees.
              </p>
              <p>
                Partial day workshops focus on skills and making effective
                slides.
              </p>
              <p>
                Multiday workshops focus on building the foundation up to
                presentation and useful forecasts and go-to-market plans.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note: We know from experience that a newer team with a working
                product needs at least four days to get a solid plan and
                presentation put together. We will provide a pre-workshop either
                via a video, or live presentation 1 to 2 weeks before the event
                to help the startups to prepare.
              </p>
